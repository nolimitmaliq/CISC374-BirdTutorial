# CISC374-BirdTutorial
This is a tutorial project used to overview Unity3D in CISC374.
I got my flap, die, and point sounds from this website https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10178-flappy-bird-sounds#goog_rewarded

While developing my game, I encountered challenges implementing the cloud feature the way I intended. One major issue was that only a single cloud would appear, moving across the screen rather than multiple clouds spawning throughout the gameplay.

Questions I Asked the AI:
    How can I implement a feature that allows multiple clouds to spawn continuously during gameplay?
    The clouds spawn briefly but then stop appearing. How can I ensure they spawn consistently?
